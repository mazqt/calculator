A project in CSS, HTML, and Javascript, where in I try to create a calculator with basic functionality. Part of my projects under the curriculum of The Odin Project.

Most of the project went rather smooth, however, I stumbled upon two main problems. The first one was an error where the calculator would brick if you returned to 0 by subtracting your way there, which turned out to be a minor flaw in the logic that I used to prevent people from simply pressing function keys at the start, which caused some issues. The second was a problem where large numbers displayed properply if they were > 1, but did not work at all if they were below 0.
